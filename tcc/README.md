This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Repo Structure
```
src/
  pages/
  components/
    ui/
  services/
  hooks/
  types/
  lib/
  styles/
```

# `pages/`

Think of `pages/` as the **route-level screens** of your app. Each file here represents a full page the user navigates to (e.g., `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/survey/:id`).

### Typical contents:

#### Route screens

* top-level UI for a specific route
* composes multiple components together (layout + feature components)
* usually minimal business logic (calls hooks/services instead)

Example files:

* `pages/LandingPage.tsx`
* `pages/LoginPage.tsx`
* `pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
* `pages/SurveyFillPage.tsx`

#### Page-specific layout and guards

* page wrappers (e.g., authenticated pages only)
* redirects or route protection logic (often using a `ProtectedRoute` component)

Example:

* `pages/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (if you keep it here; some teams put it in `components/`)

---

# `components/`

Think of `components/` as **reusable UI building blocks** used across multiple pages. Components are typically “dumb” (presentational) or lightly stateful, and can be shared across features.

### Typical contents:

#### Shared layout components

* navbar, sidebar, app shell
* consistent page structure across routes

Example files:

* `components/Sidebar.tsx`
* `components/TopNav.tsx`
* `components/AppShell.tsx`

#### Feature UI components

* reusable widgets used inside a page (but not the entire page)
* can be feature-specific but still “UI-first”

Example files:

* `components/SurveyCard.tsx`
* `components/QuestionEditor.tsx`
* `components/ResultsTable.tsx`

---

# `components/ui/`

Think of `components/ui/` as your **design system primitives**, usually generated by shadcn/ui (or hand-rolled equivalents). These are low-level building blocks that higher-level components compose.

### Typical contents:

#### shadcn/ui primitives

* Button, Card, Dialog, Tabs, Table, Dropdown, etc.
* minimal app-specific logic
* consistent styling and accessibility

Example files:

* `components/ui/button.tsx`
* `components/ui/card.tsx`
* `components/ui/dialog.tsx`
* `components/ui/table.tsx`

---

# `services/`

Think of `services/` as the **integration layer** that talks to external systems (your backend API, Cognito, S3 upload endpoints, etc.). This folder is responsible for “how to call the world.”

### Typical contents:

#### API service modules (by domain)

* functions that call backend endpoints
* returns typed data (or throws errors)
* no UI code

Example files:

* `services/surveyService.ts`
* `services/userService.ts`
* `services/carbonService.ts`

#### Auth integration utilities

* login/logout functions
* token exchange / refresh logic (depending on your auth design)

Example:

* `services/authService.ts`

---

# `hooks/`

Think of `hooks/` as your **reusable logic layer** for React — hooks wrap stateful behavior, data fetching, caching, and side-effects in a clean interface for pages/components.

### Typical contents:

#### Data fetching hooks

* wraps service calls
* handles loading/error states
* often uses React Query (TanStack Query) or SWR

Example files:

* `hooks/useSurveys.ts`
* `hooks/useSurveyResults.ts`
* `hooks/useUser.ts`

#### UI / state hooks

* reusable UI state patterns (debounce, toggles, local storage, etc.)

Example files:

* `hooks/useDebounce.ts`
* `hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`

---

# `types/`

Think of `types/` as a **shared TypeScript contract layer**. It centralizes interfaces/types so they can be reused across pages, services, and hooks.

### Typical contents:

#### Domain model types

* Survey, Question, Response, User, Role, etc.

Example files:

* `types/survey.ts`
* `types/user.ts`
* `types/inventory.ts`

#### API DTOs (request/response shapes)

* types that match backend payloads
* helps keep frontend/backed aligned

Example:

* `types/api.ts` or `types/survey.dto.ts`

---

# `lib/`

Think of `lib/` as your **shared toolbox**: reusable helper code that isn’t a React component and isn’t tied to any single feature. It usually contains low-level utilities, configuration helpers, and wrappers that many parts of the app rely on.

### Typical contents:

#### API / networking helpers

* a centralized `fetch`/`axios` wrapper for making HTTP requests
* automatically attach auth tokens (JWT) to requests
* common error handling (401/403 redirect, retry logic)
* base URL handling, timeouts, request/response typing

Example files:

* `lib/api/http.ts` (HTTP client wrapper)
* `lib/api/endpoints.ts` (API route constants)
* `lib/api/errors.ts` (standardized error types / mappers)

---

#### Environment config

* a single place to read and validate environment variables
* prevents `undefined` configs scattered across code
* keeps production/staging/dev configuration consistent

Example files:

* `lib/config/env.ts` (reads `import.meta.env`, validates required vars)
* `lib/config/constants.ts` (shared app constants)

---

#### Auth utilities (shared, not UI)

* helper functions for token storage/retrieval
* parsing JWT claims (roles/groups)
* checking login status (e.g., `isAuthenticated()`)
* building auth headers

Example files:

* `lib/auth/tokenStorage.ts`
* `lib/auth/jwt.ts`
* `lib/auth/headers.ts`

---

#### Generic utilities

* shared helper functions used across pages/components
* formatting and conversions (dates, numbers, units)
* common functional utilities (debounce, sleep, deep clone if needed)

Example files:

* `lib/date.ts`
* `lib/format.ts`
* `lib/math.ts`
* `lib/string.ts`

---

#### Styling utilities (shared helpers)

* helpers that support UI composition, but are not components
* common className merging utilities (especially with Tailwind + shadcn)

Example files:

* `lib/utils.ts` (e.g., `cn()` helper for Tailwind class merging)

---

#### Validation helpers (optional)

* shared validation schemas and helpers (if you use zod/yup)
* reusable validators (email format, required fields, etc.)

Example files:

* `lib/validation/schemas.ts`
* `lib/validation/rules.ts`

---

# `styles/`

Think of `styles/` as your **global styling configuration**. It contains Tailwind entry files, app-wide CSS rules, and theme tokens that apply across the whole app.

### Typical contents:

#### Tailwind entry + globals

* Tailwind directives and global resets
* base font and body styles

Example files:

* `styles/globals.css`

#### Theme variables (optional)

* CSS variables for colors, spacing, radius
* light/dark theme tokens (especially common with shadcn)

Example files:

* `styles/theme.css`
* `styles/tokens.css`
